# isthislevel.com

A simple, cross-platform, somewhat-tested bubblelevel style phone level. I built this because I wanted it to exist and be quick/free. I have also used this to experiment with ads, both paid ad traffic and also ad revenue. 

About 400k people have used it in the past year! Bounce rate is less than 10%, average session is about three minutes, and at any moment there is usually one or two people using it, so it must be useful enough.
